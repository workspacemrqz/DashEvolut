## Recent Changes (October 26, 2025)

### Mobile Responsiveness Improvements
- **Clean Mobile Menu**: Single elegant floating button (gradient background, rounded-xl, hover scale effect) that opens sidebar overlay
- **Unified Sidebar Design**: Mobile sidebar includes gradient header with logo - no duplicate headers
- **Page Containers**: All pages use `overflow-x-hidden`, `min-w-0` to prevent horizontal scrolling, `pl-16` for menu button clearance
- **KPI Cards**: Adjusted padding from `p-6` to `p-4 sm:p-6` for better mobile spacing
- **Typography**: Implemented responsive text sizes (e.g., `text-lg sm:text-xl lg:text-2xl`)
- **Button Actions**: Simplified button structure in headers, removed unnecessary wrapper divs
- **Filter Controls**: Using responsive pattern `w-full sm:w-[Xpx]` across all pages
- **Gest√£o Financeira Page**: Completely refactored to match the standard Header pattern used in other pages

## UI/UX Decisions
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Full mobile responsiveness with card layouts for tables and KPIs, single-column forms on mobile, and appropriate touch targets. All tables (subscriptions, clients, projects, expenses) convert to vertical card layouts on mobile. Proposal list cards stack buttons vertically on mobile. All filter dropdowns and search inputs use full-width on mobile (w-full) and fixed widths only on larger screens (sm:w-[Xpx]) to prevent horizontal overflow.
- **Dark Theme Design System**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for a consistent dark theme.
- **Clean Visuals**: Removal of default focus outlines for a cleaner aesthetic.
- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Desktop sidebar toggles between collapsed (icon-only) and expanded states with smooth transitions.
- **Consistent Filtering**: Standardized dropdown selects for filters across the application.
- **Organized Forms**: Subscription form uses collapsible sections (Basic Info, Notes, Credentials, Files) for improved UX.
- **Localization**: Complete translation of URLs and UI text to Portuguese Brazilian.
